## March Meetups with Guest Speakers

February was tough on your local civic hackers. Our early month meetup was snowed out, and the late month edition featured a temperature of 47F *inside* the TRI-Lab. So enough about February. 

March brought our meetups to a new level with excellent guest speakers both nights. On Monday the 2nd, Marisa Petriccia and Kate Pisano from [ServeRI](http://www.serverhodeisland.org/) told us about their systems for managing their volunteer snow-shoveling program, which saw an explosion of need this winter. And on the 16th, we talked with Nicole Pollock, who was recently sworn-in as the first Chief Innovation Officer in the city of Providence.

### Snowed In

With a top-five seasonal snowfall coming almost all in a six week stretch this past winter, shoveling out the elderly or infirm became a critical service.  According to our speakers, some people were snowed in for over a week. Kate and Marisa deployed a force of volunteer shovelers, and they got the job done. 

While they could always use more volunteers, they felt like they could have been more effective if they had better tools to manage what has rapidly become a very large program. Mostly using spreadsheets, hand-entered texts and 3rd-party read-only databases, they: 

# vet the volunteers (a crucial safety issue)
# field the service requests
# assign the volunteers requests
# communicate the assignment to the volunteers 
# follow up on performance. 

In the discussion, we explored a range of approaches and learned about the safety and privacy concerns that make this service uncomfortable with a public platforms like the admirable (Snowcrew)[http://snowcrew.org]. 

After we broke up into work groups, their table was the last one going. As they left, Marisa and Kate expressed a new sense of hope. Somebody understood *their* need and would volunteer to help out.

### Innovator in Chief

This is a very big deal. Mayor Jorge Elorza's created a Chief Innovation Officer for the city of Providence and appointed Nicole Pollock to that position. Her brief is to work across departments advocating for and assisting in a transition toward more integrated information systems and smoother work flows. 

Not yet 60 days on the job, Nicole spent three hours with Code Island, speaking about the challenges and opportunities in her work. Co-captain Ryan Kelly framed the discussion by playing [this video from Gov.uk]() on Government as a Platform.

### Government as a Platform

"GaaP is too "squishy" for avg gov emp. Everything is custom in their world. Narrative to show customization."

"Usually not actually custom processes; most systems can do what you need."

"Weather data as a platform: consistent over many decades."

Still lots of paper. Still lots of "who would want this data...for what?" Still lots of unregimented/undocumented processes. Most databases can't communicate with each other.

Lots of contracts, but no central repository of contracts. Hard to capture the moment when many contracts come up at once. That's the opportunity to shift to a more unified platform.

Only working on her own right now, so hard to have immediate impact. Meeting with department heads, learning about process, tools and issues. Working to determine meaningful metric and data to track them. 

Also focusing on lean process, which means studying and documenting process. In the end, this will make for better data sets.
