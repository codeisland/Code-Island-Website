### Government as a Platform

"GaaP is too "squishy" for avg gov emp. Everything is custom in their world. Narrative to show customization."

"Usually not actually custom processes; most systems can do what you need."

"Weather data as a platform: consistent over many decades."

Still lots of paper. Still lots of "who would want this data...for what?" Still lots of unregimented/undocumented processes. Most databases can't communicate with each other.

Lots of contracts, but no central repository of contracts. Hard to capture the moment when many contracts come up at once. That's the opportunity to shift to a more unified platform.
