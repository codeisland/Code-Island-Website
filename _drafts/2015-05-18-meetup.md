## May Meetup with Newport Guests

In preparation for our [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org) event at the [State House on June 6th](http://hackforchange.org/events/providence-ri-national-day-event/), we met with some folks who are running a [hackathon in Middletown](http://www.rihackathon.com/) on that same weekend. We're exploring how we can collaborate between the two sites. (We'll probably use computers...)

* [Register for Code Island's NDoCH](http://www.meetup.com/Rhode-Island-Code-for-America-Brigade/events/222454746/) over on our Meetup page.

### The Plan

Our event is only from 8am to 4pm at the State House, while the Middletown event runs continues from Friday night through Sunday. Our project is to try to *complete* the [Local Digital Services Census](http://hackforchange.org/challenges/local-digital-services-census/) for all 39 cities and towns in Rhode Island. The Middletown group is looking to build an app that could help create a Maker Map, plotting all the Maker community people and assets on a map.

Our plan is to combine our resources and work on both projects. We're going to find some transportation options to bring some of the Middletown people up to Providence to work at the State House, then we'll bring some of the Code Island people down to Middletown for the overnight session.

The Local Digital Services Census was developed by Code Island's former fellow Hannah Young, and the [output list](https://service-census.herokuapp.com/) looks similar to the [Sunlight Foundation's Open Data Census](http://us-city.census.okfn.org/). But these services are more focused on the kinds of basic things that average people would want to do. 

It also aggregates the specific links to those resources, and that's a useful feature.
