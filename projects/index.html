<h2>Code Island Projects</h2>
<p>
  Code Island is working on many projects simultaneously. The most prominent or advanced include:
</p>
<p>
  <h4>Candidates Questionnaire</h4> We wanted to get the 2014 Providence mayoral candidates on the record about how they would approach and prioritize issues of open data and open government, so we sent <a href="/candidate-questionnaire/">this questionnaire</a> to the three major candidates. <a href="/candidate-questionnaire/responses/">All three responded!</a> Our top-line takeaway is that these issues are now at the level that candidates for elected office <strong>must</strong> be able to speak to them in a specific way.
  <br /><strong>STATUS: Complete</strong>

  <h4>Budget Visualization</h4> A way for people to see state-level expenditures expressed at the “checkbook” level, organized by area of impact (i.e., transportation, education, environment), as opposed to source of funding (i.e., Dept. of Admin, Dept. of Env. Man., Dept. of Trans.).
