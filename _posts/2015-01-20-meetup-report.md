title: January 2015 Update
---

2015 is off to a great start for Code Island, with two great meetups in January and lots of new faces. If you click over to [our Join page](/join/), you can see who's been contributing to our work. 

### Announcements

Starting in February, we're switching our [meetups](http://www.meetup.com/Rhode-Island-Code-for-America-Brigade/) to **Monday evenings** and we'll be starting at 6:30pm instead of 6. Several people have mentioned to us that they have prior commitments on Tuesdays, so we're going to see how Mondays work. 

**Code Across America** is scheduled for February 20-22, 2015. We're looking for a venue to host another large event on one of those days. Stay tuned for updates. 

Until next time...
